Very good solution. Extensive examples with explanations, good documentation of new rules. 
Implementation seems to work great; it still has some poisoning, but that cannot be avoided and proper measures were taken in the subeffecting to remove part of the poisoning.
There does seem to be a minor mistake in the List-Intro-Cons rule, where the tail is required to contain annotation pi of the newly constructed Cons cell. I think this is incorrect, but I am unsure. 
Apart from that, no real errors could be found.
As far as I could find, the bonus exercise regarding polyvariance was not implemented.
