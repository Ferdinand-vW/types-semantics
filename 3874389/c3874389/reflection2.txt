All proofs have been proven. I could easily have achieved some more conciseness with certain proofs
and lemmas. The code is therefore much bigger than it needs to be.

determinism & uniqueness of normal forms proofs: 1
Definition of big step semantics: 1
Big-to-small and small-to-big lemmas: 2
Soundness and completeness of big-step semantics: 2
Small step semantics, big step semantics and denotational semantics of pairs: 1.5
Updating existing proofs to handle pairs: 1.5

As said all proofs have been proven, so full points have to be given. Although one might argue
that some points could be deducted for the lack of conciseness. But I don't know whether 
points should be deducted for that reason, so I decide not to.
