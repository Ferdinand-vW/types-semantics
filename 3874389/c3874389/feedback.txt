= Exercise 1
Almost every exercise has been completed fully (except the binary_inverse)
Every proof is succinct with no unnecessary steps.
As I did not complete the binary exercises some longer proofs
	were harder to follow. Some contained some techniques I did not
	yet encounter in first chapters (inversion, pose, remember), it shouldn't
	be necessary probably. Comments could help understand the long statements 
	to be proven.

(As there was no model solution, and I did not finish binary_inverse myself I
could not provide answers for that)

The grading was not specified clearly.
Induction chapter:
	* 11 (required) exercises
	* 28 stars
List chapter:
	* 6 (required) exercises
	* 18 stars
Which totals at 46 stars, 41 were earned. Grade:
	* No free points assumed: 8.9
	* Usual 1 free point: 9.0



= Exercise 2
Normal forms: 1

Small-to-big: 1
Soundnes of big step: 1
Completeness of big step: 1

Final mark: 10.0

Overall all of the definitions are valid. However (as you might have seen
yourself), lots of defintions are far longer than the ones form the solutions.
Sometimes this is because the solution seperatus some definitions in seperate
functions (and in reality is not that much shorter). However most of the times
it is due to the way you used the pattern matching on arguments. By choosing
the right pattern and forcing specific arguments to a specific value, most
definitions can be shortened.
