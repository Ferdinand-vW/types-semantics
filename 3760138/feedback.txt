Unfortunately no implementation has been made (is this on purpose, or did
handing in the exercise went wrong?), therefore no points can be given.

Exercise 2

(small change needed to be made  for parse error in big step data definition)
Not sure why the pairs were not introduced. As the other parts are completed
really well, it seems you can do the pairs probably.

* determinism & uniqueness of normal forms proofs
	 This looks really clear. 1

* Definition of big step semantics
	Pretty much by the book, very well. 1

* Big-to-small and small-to-big lemmas
	You could do with more implicit parameters as you can see they're all fixed,
	but it might help in completing the proofs so that's ok. Looks fine for the
	rest. 1 + 1

* Soundness and completeness of big-step semantics
	Same remarks as above, implicit params could be used in soudness proof. But no
	problem. For the rest it's great. 1 + 1

* Small step semantics, big step semantics and denotational semantics of pairs
	This was not imlemented. 0

* Updating existing proofs to handle pairs
	This was not imlemented. 0

Final mark: 7.0
