Determinism & uniqueness of normal forms proofs (1):
Deterministic is identical to model solution, except for way of proving contradictions, but both ways are correct. 
Uonf in the double-cons case could have been done faster, but still correct. (The second with line is not needed.)
Points: 1

Definition of big step semantics (1):
Mostly identical to model solution, except the model solution uses the (previously undefined) function vsucc, while this solution inlined the definition of that function. 
Points: 1

Big-to-small and small-to-big lemmas (1 + 1):
Basically identical to model solution.
Value-to-value matches on term instead of proof; proof would have elimintated unused cases.
Sbt uses a big, unneeded helper function (bigstep-values) but it is still correct. 
Points: 2

Soundness and completeness of big-step semantics (1 + 1):
Both proof correct, but could be shortened by better use of implicit parameters.
Points: 2

Small step semantics, big step semantics and denotational semantics of pairs (1.5):
Not implemented.

Updating existing proofs to handle pairs (1.5):
