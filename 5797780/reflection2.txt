# Determinism and uniqueness of normal forms proofs

1/1. The determinism proof looks cleaner than the model solution because the
term arguments have been made implicit. I used `valuesDoNotStep` instead of
`values-are-normal-forms`, but of course they are equivalent.

# Definition of big-step semantics

1/1. Isomorphic to model solution.

# Big-to-small and small-to-big lemmas

Big-to-small (1/1): this could have been more concise by avoiding some
let-bindings.

Small-to-big (1/1): the with-clause in `prepend-step` could have been avoided.

# Soundness and completeness of big-step semantics

Completeness (1/1): it was possible after all to combine the nested with-clauses
into one. The trick was to first do evaluation of the value first, and the
recursive call after the bar.

Soundness (1/1): the proof is unnecessarily long, mostly due to the nested
with-clauses that I failed to combine. Also, the term argument could have been
made implicit.

# Small-step semantics, big-step semantics, and denotational semantics of pairs

1.5/1.5. Isomorphic to model solution.

# Updating existing proofs to handle pairs

1.5/1.5. Same remarks as before apply, but the proofs are correct.
