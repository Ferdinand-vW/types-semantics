Grade 5/9

There is not too much to say about this. Due to time mismanagement the extension to pairs was not really ever attempted.

The grade is obtained by removing points from the big-step semantics soundness (which was left incomplete) and removing all 
points regarding the extension as it was only roughly sketched out.
