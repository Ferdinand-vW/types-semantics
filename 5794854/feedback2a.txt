There are no goals left, and the file typechecks. Additional exercises have been
carried out and therefore all the 9 points are awarded.

It looks like a big mess though, but i guess that's just how AGDA is. I try to
keep similar arguments and equals signs aligned.

I cannot say anything else. Good job.
