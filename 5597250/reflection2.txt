Most of the proofs are correct. However, there are still some empty cases. I graded myself 7.9 out of the 9 points.

* determinism & uniqueness of normal forms proofs 1
* Definition of big step semantics 1
* Big-to-small and small-to-big lemmas: 1.9
one case value-to-value is missing.
* Soundness and completeness of big-step semantics: 2
Complete and sound is proving
* Small step semantics, big step semantics and denotational semantics of pairs: 0.5
Several cases are missing.
* Updating existing proofs to handle pairs 1.5
Complete and sound proofs for pairs


1 + 1 + 1.9 + + 2 + 1.5 + 0.5 = 7.9
Total: 7.9/9
