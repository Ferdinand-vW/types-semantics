Overall a quite nice implementation. Also a nice variety of examples are
included, altough some formatting in the examples could improve readability.

(i)        : 2.5
             Implemented, as the doc states not all constraints are solved
             completely. Also no documentation about this part, but don't
             really know what to document about it.
(ii)       : 2.0
             Implemented and seems to work OK.
(iii)      : 2.5
             Implemented and seems to work OK.
(iv)       : 0.0
             Not implemented
Readability: 0.5
             Code could be a lot clearer. Try to stick to 72 characters per
             line (or 80 at the very most). Never use a mixed indentation of
             tabs and spaces in Haskell, as no one can garuantee the width of
             a tab character, this may lead to compilation errors.
             Documentation was nice.
Bonus      : 0.0
             Not implemented
