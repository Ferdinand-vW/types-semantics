Most proofs were well done. Some could have been done a bit more concise by
generalizing certain proofs of the same case.
There were however a couple proofs (mostly for pairs) that were missing, including
an incorrect definition of Pair which causes deterministic to be unprovable. 


*determinism & uniqueness of normal forms proofs: 1
*Definition of big step semantics: 1
*Big-to-small and small-to-big lemmas: 1.7
Total of 3 proofs missing in big-to-small, value-to-value and small-to-big.
Since there were quite a few proofs to solve, I counted a missing proof as a 0.1 subtraction.
*Soundness and completeness of big-step semantics: 2
*Small step semantics, big step semantics and denotational semantics of pairs: 1.3
Incorrect small step definition for Pair. Now determinism cannot be proved.
*Updating existing proofs to handle pairs: 0.5
progress is missing the pair case
deterministic hasn't been proven for all pair small-step semantics.
prepend-step hasn't been proven for all pair big-step semantics
