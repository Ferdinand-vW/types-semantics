To grade the type and effect systems submission, use the following:

(i)   3.5 points or less (0.5 for examples, 0.5 for docs, rest for code)
(ii)  2   points or less (0.5 for examples, 0.5 for docs, rest for code)
(iii) 2.5 points or less (0.5 for examples, 0.5 for docs, rest for code)
(iv)  1   point or less

General readability of the pdf and the code: 1 point or less

Issues to think of:
  * do examples cover important cases, like list of functions, functions on
    pairs?
  * is subeffecting done in a way that tries to prevent poisoning? You can
    usually tell from the unification rule for functions (equating the
    annotation variables in that case usually means that active measures
    against poisoning were not taken).
  * Is the flow of the case statements done well?
  * does the documentation provide the necessary type rules and explanations
  * maybe it goes without saying, but if some part is partially answered,
    you should estimate the percentage that was done correctly.

Bonuspoint:
  - is there a polyvariant implementation?
  - if yes, give up to one point (don't forget to run it on examples where it 
    makes a difference)

-- Grading

(i) The code is not complete, there is an undefined in the algorithm W
implementation. The examples included do not work at all. There is no
documentation either. At least the implementation uses unicode symbols and looks
really cool.

(ii)  There is no implementation, examples or documentation.
(iii) There is no implementation, examples or documentation.
(iv)  There is no documentation

(Readability)

There is no report.
