Quite some holes left, but in sub-expressions. Producing IsValue values seems to be the problem mostly.
Some parts (holes) just need more destructuring, when calling progress I split on Left and Right, but
twice the Left case is then not completed. The model solution shows the problem, should be calling progress
on second term, not first.
With deterministic one could either go with valuesDoNotStep and it get's messy, or like the model does,
use values-are-normal-form. 


* determinism & uniqueness of normal forms proofs
	 Pretty much completed, slightly messy (see remark above) 0.9

* Definition of big step semantics
	Not sure why value-to-value for succ does not work like the model shows...
	Structured differently (no IsZeroTrue/False, but with IsZeroZero and IsZeroSucc) which makes it miss minor part
	and messes up other parts. 0.9

* Big-to-small and small-to-big lemmas
	Considering the slightly different structure mentioned above, this makes this almost work.
	But the basics are there. Prepend-steps unnecessarily messed up, with explicit params it could
	be worked out easier... 0.9 + 0.9

* Soundness and completeness of big-step semantics
	Done well. 1 + 1

* Small step semantics, big step semantics and denotational semantics of pairs
	As mentioned above, we do recursion on the first term when second term should be used. This
	gets us stuck. here and there. 1.3

* Updating existing proofs to handle pairs
	This is done ok, considering the remarks above. 1.3

Final mark: 8.2
