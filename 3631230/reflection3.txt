To grade the type and effect systems submission, use the following:

(i)   3.5 points or less (0.5 for examples, 0.5 for docs, rest for code)
    -- (0.5) Examples cover the basics
    -- (0.4) Mention of book rules is a bit of a shortcut
    -- (2) basic analysis ok, poisoning implemented but not fully correct

(ii)  2   points or less (0.5 for examples, 0.5 for docs, rest for code)
  -- (0.4) Error example would be good. Otherwise ok.
  -- (0.4) Constraints dealing unclear
  -- (0.8) Parse problem, unclear dealing with constraints (and perhaps incorrect)

(iii) 2.5 points or less (0.5 for examples, 0.5 for docs, rest for code)
  -- (0) Not there
  -- (0.4) Seems ok, again constraint dealing unclear.
  -- (0) Not there...

(iv)  1   point or less
  -- (0) not implemented

   
General readability of the pdf and the code: 1 point or less
  -- (0.8) alg_w and u  (code) are not commented well, though the books
  provides this, but it could be better. Otherwise it's ok.

Issues to think of: 
  * do examples cover important cases, like list of functions, functions on
    pairs?
  * is subeffecting done in a way that tries to prevent poisoning? You can
    usually tell from the unification rule for functions (equating the
    annotation variables in that case usually means that active measures
    against poisoning were not taken).
  * Is the flow of the case statements done well?
  * does the documentation provide the necessary type rules and explanations
  * maybe it goes without saying, but if some part is partially answered,
    you should estimate the percentage that was done correctly.
    
Bonuspoint: 
  - is there a polyvariant implementation?
  - if yes, give up to one point (don't forget to run it on examples where it 
    makes a difference)

  -- (0.8) As stated explicitly, this should have been implemented apart
      from the monomorphic code. Nevertheless, this is the implementation we
      actually run, so we can see how this goes. It goes very well. However,
      "partialif.fun" show h != k in signature, which should be the case right?

Score for:
(i)        : 2.9
(ii)       : 1.6
(iii)      : 0.4
(iv)       : 0
Readability: 0.8
Bonus      : 0
------------------
Total score: 5.7
(between 0 and 11)
