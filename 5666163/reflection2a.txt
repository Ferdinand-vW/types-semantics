At this point i really fall behind because i lack understanding of what is
actually going on. My solving strategy is 1) Deduce which arguments can be
implicit. 2) pattern match on ALL the remaining arguments. 3) Make agda fill in
contradictions and refl. Trial and error the rest...

Even with explanation from Joao i'm unable to solve most of the exercises :(
