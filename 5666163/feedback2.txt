Unfortunately, most of the cases are not complete. So by looking at the grading guidelines the total points I can give is 3.3 out of the 9 points.

determinism & uniqueness: .8
big step semantics: 1
big-to-small & small-to-big: 1
Soundness and completeness: .5
Pairs: 0

.8 + 1 + 1 + .5 = 3.3
Total: 3.3/9
